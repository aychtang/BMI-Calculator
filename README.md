BMI-Calculator
==============

This was my first project experimenting with live data transfer using socket.io. The app takes user input, calculates the users BMI
from the input, rendering it on the client before inserting the values into a database. The server sends back the average of the 
previous entries into the database which is then compared with the clients value.

Made with love and [jQuery, Express, Socket.io, mySQL];
